This is a personal page where I will store summaries, thoughts and lessons
from the books that I am reading.

It is also an opportunity to test and practice new front-end dev skills, as and
when I learn them. So, with time, the page will become more UX/UI friendly and
increase in complexity.

To begin with, I will use it as an opportunity to practice CSS and Bootstrap.

                <h2 class="text-danger">Summary</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Storytelling that transports you back to being a child. Stephen Fry retells the most well-known Greek myths with a modern narrative twist
                and introduces us to Olympus' most relevant and prolific Gods and Godesses. Throughout the book, Fry draws etymological links between the Myths
                and our modern-day language, as well as drawing out some of the key philosophical and moral underpinnings of the world the Greeks painted to make
                sense of their own. </p>
                <h2 class=" text-danger">Lessons Learned</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Religion</strong> - especially Christianity - gets SO much inspiration from the Roman Myths (Or maybe the way humans try to make sense of their world is ridiculously
                    consistent throughout the ages.).</li>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Xenia</strong> - being a good host/guest rules supreme under the mythological paradigm, which is interesting and I imagine was a way of dealing with the
                  endless travelling that must have taken place around that time (there is comfort in knowing that most people subscribe to a belief system that
                  will be conducive towards travelling to unknown parts).</li>
                  <li class="text-justify"><strong>Chronos</strong> - time - was born out of Chaos and devoured his children in the same way that time devours everything in order to survive as Tine. Yet, the Olympians - the future- came anyway.</li>

                </ul>
                <h2 class=" text-danger">Rambling Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="text-justify"> It's interesting to hear how humans have tried to make sense of that which they do not understand, almost like a compulsion. The appeal of
                someone/something being in control seems almost irresistable to us, which is strange in the case of the Greek myths given they way that they
              conceive of the controlling being is distinctly flawed, fickle and almost human. You would think this is far less comforting a thought than the all-benevolent
              Christian God, although it's undoubtedly more entertaining.

              I also really enjoyed the parts where the links between the myths and their modern-day remnants - be they in literary inspiration, etymology or even Thought - were elucidated. That
              said, I also recognise that part of the reason I enjoyed it so much is because I got great comfort from it; it was comfortable and knowable and distinctly Western. No harm in reading
              that type of thing but good to be aware that I ought to learn more about the myths and legends that underpin less familiar cultures too. </p>
